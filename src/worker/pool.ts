/**
 * Generic worker pool for concurrent async task execution.

 * and deadlock risks of Promise.race + Set semaphore patterns.
 * Results are stored at their input index, preserving call order.
 *
 * Supports:
 * - Fixed-size worker pool
 * - Overall timeout protection (graceful — returns partial results)
 * - Max task limit
 * - Per-task completion callback
 */

/**
 * Execute a list of async tasks with a fixed-size worker pool.
 *
 * Workers pull from a shared index counter, so the system stays
 * busy even if some tasks take longer than others. Results are
 * stored at their input position, preserving the original order.
 *
 * On timeout, the pool **does not reject** — instead it sets a flag
 * that stops idle workers, waits for in-flight workers to finish their
 * current task, and returns whatever results have been collected so far.
 *
 * @param tasks - Array of async task factories
 * @param options - Pool configuration
 * @param onTaskComplete - Optional callback after each task completes
 * @returns Results array in input order (gaps for tasks that were not started)
